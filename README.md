# DNN-for-Face-Recognition

This repo contains parts (mainly part 8-10) I did for a machine learning course at University of Toronto. The link to the project description is at https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc411h/winter/projects/proj2/

In part 8, I used PyTorch to train a fully-connected neural network with a single hidden layer to classify actors from the FaceScrub dataset.

In part 9, I visualized the weights of hidden units to study how neural networks see the data. 

In part 10, I fine-tuned the pre-trained AlexNet convolutional neural network to perform classification on a new collection of images, which are images of actors from the FaceScrub dataset.

Please also read report.pdf for a detailed report for those parts.
